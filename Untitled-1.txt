## FAQ
#### Can I use EmailJS for free?
We believe comunication is fundamental human rights, so we also provide a free version
                    of EmailJS service to public. We don't serve ads or sell your email content or history.
                    EmailJS Free plan is supported by EmailJS paid customers. If you would like to support
                    our mission, please consider
                    [upgrading to a paid plans](https://www.emailjs.com/pricing/)
                    for security and more features.

#### Can't I use services like Sendgrid or Mandrill directly?
All email services require some sort of authentication to send the emails on your behalf.
                    That makes it a really bad idea to use them directly from client-side – revealing your
                    password or your secret keys will allow anyone to send emails on your behalf.
EmailJS keeps your authentication details on the server-side, and the client-side code
                    just triggers a predefined email template, similarly to how any
                    client-server application is working.

#### Does EmailJS expose my account to spam?
A better way to think of EmailJS in terms of security is not as a service that
                    allows you to send emails from your code, but rather as a service that allows you
                    to create a predefined set of emails via the dashboard, and then just trigger the emails
                    from the code. This is quite similar to how emails are usually sent via a
                    proprietary server code, and also to the way products
                    like Intercom or customer.io are working.
Additionally, we've also developed various tools to prevent abuse – for instance,
                    we have IP based rate limits to prevent bots from spamming, the whitelist of origin,
                    and also support reCAPTCHA tests to make sure that a human is sending
                    the email (although it's up to the developer to turn this feature on).

#### Can I send HTML emails?
Of course!
HTML emails are fully supported, and you can create them either using our
                    visual text editor or by entering the HTML code directly. That said,
                    most email clients don't fully support all the HTML
                    and CSS features, so please refer to this
                    [Campaign Monitor guide  (opens new window)](https://www.campaignmonitor.com/css/)
                    to learn about the various restrictions.

#### What about plain text emails?
Our service sends emails as multipart related! This means that emails
                    contain HTML and plain text. If HTML is not supported or denied,
                    the text part will be displayed.
